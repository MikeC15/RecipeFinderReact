Mike's Recipe Finder App

https://mikesrecipefinder.herokuapp.com/

MikesRecipeFinder is an app that I developed out of constant necessity. Everyday my wife and I struggle to decide what we want to cook for dinner. Usually we spend up to an hour looking through our ingredients or discussing best options or meals weve made in the past. Now we have a solution to streamline our search for a delicious meal. With MikesRecipeFinder you can quickly enter either your favorite ingredients that you want to eat tonight, or enter the ingredients you found in you fridge. My app will give out recipes using your combination of ingredients to take the guess work out of dinner time. Its time to make dinner choices easy with MikesRecipeFinder
